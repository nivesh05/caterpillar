# Caterpillar

Given the recent interest in [progressive web
apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/),
this experimental project investigates whether it is feasible to automatically port [Chrome Apps](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps) to web sites that run offline in Chrome and other modern browsers. 

## Installation

Extract the code into a folder. Install dependencies with pip and npm:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt && npm install

## Usage

```bash
./caterpillar.py config -i config.json
./caterpillar.py convert -c config.json my-chrome-app/ my-web-app/
```

This will convert an unpackaged Chrome App `my-chrome-app/` into a progressive
web app `my-web-app/` and generate a conversion report inside a subdirectory of
`my-web-app/` (depending on the configuration options you set).

For more detailed documentation, see [the manual](docs/manual.md).

## Running Tests

Running all tests:

```bash
./run_tests.py
```

Running Python tests only:

```bash
./run_tests.py py
```

Running specific Python tests:

```bash
./run_tests.py py module_test
./run_tests.py py module_test.TestClass
./run_tests.py py module_test.TestClass.test_function
```

Running JavaScript tests only:

```bash
./run_tests.py js
```

The JavaScript tests assume you have Chrome and Firefox (version 45 or greater).
If you want to run the tests on different browsers, edit karma.conf.js.
